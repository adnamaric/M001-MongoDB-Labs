Lab: Launching Mongod

	Launch your own mongod process in the IDE terminal:
	From your IDE terminal, launch a mongod instance that listens for connections on port 27000.
	If you run into any issues, you can always type Ctrl-C in the terminal where mongod is running to stop it. Then you can restart it with a new configuration.
	When the process is running, you can open a new tab in the IDE to use the Mongo shell, but this is optional for this assignment.
	Once you've run the proper commands, click "Run Tests" to run a suite of tests that will check the configuration of mongod. 
	The results of these tests will let you know which steps you've yet to complete.

Solution:
        Terminal(0):
	mongod --port 27000
